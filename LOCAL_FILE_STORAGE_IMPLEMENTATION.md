# Local File Storage Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of local file storage for uploaded documents in the AI Assistant application. The enhancement allows users to store original files locally while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Key Features

### 1. File Storage Manager (`FileStorageManager.kt`)
- **Purpose**: Handles all local file storage operations
- **Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/bigcash/ai/vectordb/utils/FileStorageManager.kt`
- **Key Methods**:
  - `saveFile(fileName, fileData)`: Saves uploaded files with unique timestamps
  - `getFile(filePath)`: Retrieves files from local storage
  - `deleteFile(filePath)`: Removes files from local storage
  - `fileExists(filePath)`: Checks if a file exists
  - `getFileSize(filePath)`: Gets file size in bytes

### 2. Enhanced PDF Entity (`PdfEntity.kt`)
- **New Field**: `localFilePath: String` - stores the path to the locally saved file
- **Updated Methods**: `equals()` and `hashCode()` now include the local file path

### 3. Repository Integration (`PdfRepository.kt`)
- **File Storage**: Automatically saves uploaded files to local storage during PDF processing
- **File Retrieval**: Provides methods to access original files
- **File Cleanup**: Deletes local files when PDFs are removed from the database
- **New Methods**:
  - `getOriginalFile(pdfEntity)`: Gets the original file for a PDF entity
  - `hasOriginalFile(pdfEntity)`: Checks if original file exists
  - `getOriginalFileSize(pdfEntity)`: Gets the size of the original file

### 4. UI Enhancements (`PdfManagementScreen.kt`)
- **View Original Button**: New button to open original files with external apps
- **File Path Display**: Shows the local filename in the PDF list
- **File Provider Integration**: Uses Android's FileProvider for secure file sharing

### 5. Chat Integration (`ChatViewModel.kt`)
- **Enhanced Document Data**: Includes information about original file availability
- **File Access Methods**: Provides access to original files from chat context

## File Storage Structure

```

## Implementation Details

### File Naming Convention
- Format: `{originalName}_{timestamp}.{extension}`
- Example: `report_20241201_143022.pdf`
- Purpose: Prevents filename conflicts and maintains chronological order

### Security
- Files are stored in the app's private internal storage
- FileProvider is used for secure file sharing with external apps
- No external storage permissions required for Android 10+

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if file storage fails
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- File existence checks before operations

## Usage Examples

### Uploading a Document
1. User selects a file through the UI
2. File is saved to local storage via `FileStorageManager`
3. PDF entity is created with the local file path
4. Text extraction and embedding generation proceed as before

### Viewing Original File
1. User clicks the "View Original" button in the PDF list
2. System retrieves the file using the stored path
3. File is opened with an appropriate external app

### Deleting a Document
1. User deletes a PDF from the list
2. System removes the PDF from the database
3. Local file is automatically deleted

## Benefits

1. **Complete Document Preservation**: Original files are maintained alongside extracted text
2. **Future Retrieval**: Users can access full documents when needed
3. **Seamless Integration**: No changes to existing workflow
4. **Storage Efficiency**: Only one copy of each file is stored
5. **Cross-App Compatibility**: Files can be opened with any compatible app

## Configuration

### AndroidManifest.xml
- Added FileProvider configuration
- No additional permissions required

### file_paths.xml
- Defines the uploads directory for FileProvider
- Ensures secure file access

## Future Enhancements

1. **File Compression**: Optional compression for large files
2. **Cloud Sync**: Integration with cloud storage services
3. **File Versioning**: Support for multiple versions of the same document
4. **Batch Operations**: Bulk file management features
5. **Storage Analytics**: Usage statistics and cleanup recommendations

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and logging. To test:

1. Upload various file types (PDF, images, documents)
2. Verify files are saved to the correct directory
3. Test file retrieval and external app opening
4. Confirm file deletion removes both database and local file
5. Check error handling with invalid files or storage issues

## Maintenance

- Files are stored in app's private directory
- No manual cleanup required
- Optional cleanup method available for old files
- Storage usage is managed by the Android system
